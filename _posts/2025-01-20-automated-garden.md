A few years ago I decided to make a garden next to a lake so I could use the lake to water the garden. This evolved into the current project that senses the soil
and fills a rain barrel when the soil becomes too dry.  The sensor data is gathered with an arduino and presented as a prometheus data format.  The arduino
has an ethernet shield and uses power over ethernet.
